SYMPHONY LABS - ABOUT

Symphony Labs is a homebrewing collective with extensive chemistry, computer scienceand operational security experience. 

The transgender community has been historically overlooked and underserved by the medical establishment. In addition, we find that existing homebrew providers have unreliable stock, inferior product, and high prices at the cost of accesibility. Our goal is to provide a superior, safe product to those in need. By purchasing you agree that you are of the age of majority in your jurisdiction.
